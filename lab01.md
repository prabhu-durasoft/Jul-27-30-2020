* You will practice TDD approach using jest
* Remember to write test cases before you write code
* You will implement a guessing game
* Generate a random number from 1 to 100
* User will play the game till she guesses the number correct.

* For example this is how the game will progress
* Say the random number is 77.

```
> 50
Aim Higher
> 75
Aim Higher
> 90
Aim Lower
> 80
Aim Lower
> 77
You've got it in 4 attempts!!!
```

* Remember the test cases are the users of your game
* Create guessing-game.js and guessing-game-test.js files
